# MyReads
This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

## Installation & Launch Instructions
Install the necessary packages with `npm install` and launch the application with `npm start`. At this point, the app should be available to you at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## create-react-app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
